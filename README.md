# CHD Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Coronary heart disease Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier
This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) based on the input features. The dataset used for this project is the Cleveland heart disease dataset, which contains various patient features like age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. along with their target CHD status.

### Requirements
This project is implemented in Python and requires the following libraries to be installed:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the BioLINCC heart disease dataset, which can be found in the ioLINCC website .
### Implementation

The project consists of the following files:

coronary_heart_disease_prediction.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the project.
heart.csv: the dataset used for the project.
README.md: a readme file describing the project.
Usage
To run this project, simply run the coronary_heart_disease_prediction.ipynb file in a Jupyter notebook environment.

The Jupyter notebook contains detailed descriptions of each step of the project including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

### Results
The Decision Tree Classifier model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set. The feature importance analysis revealed that the number of major vessels, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate achieved were the most important features in predicting CHD.

### Conclusion
In this project, we built a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the occurrence of CHD. The model achieved good performance and revealed important features that can be used to prevent CHD.
